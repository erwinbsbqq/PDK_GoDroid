/**
 * @brief Relinks a binary gp2 program, moving around attributes according to the remap table.
 * @param po A linked program object containing a vertex shader program
 * @param attrib_remap An array of 16 elemets containing remapping instructions.
 *        Example: If attrib_array[9] = 3, then attribute 9 should be remapped to attribute 3.
 * @param rewrite_symbols If true, the function will also rewrite the symbol table and stream table.
 *        Setting this field to TRUE is what you want, but some rare workarounds (like 4326) might require you not to.
 * @note
 *        The attribute remap table must contain legal values (0..15), or the function will assertcrash
 *        The program can technically be relinked multiple times, but every time you alias two attributes,
 *        you can never un-alias them. It is therefore advisable to keep a copy of the original program
 *        if you want to do this process more than once.
