 *        This function is thus useful for both skipping unknown blocks as
 *        well as getting the block you actually want.
 *        As a lightweight alternative to a full block graph, this functionality covers
 *        60% of all the required validation (peek covering the last 40%). Why make it more difficult?
 * @param steam A pointer to the stream struct. This parameter acts as an in-out parameter,
 *        with its input value being the start of the block to read, the output value being the
 *        place in the stream to continue reading (start of data or next block depending on outcome).
 * @param expected_header The header we are expecting to find; and thus ultimately the condition for
 *        reading or skipping the block.
 * @return The size of the block found, or 0 if the block was a mismatch or otherwise problem reading the stream.
 * @note  If the block considered is too big to actually fit the remaining stream data, we have a faulty stream.
 *        The function will handle this by emptying the stream, then return 0 as if we had a mismatch.
 *        This means that no matter what stream data exists, a while loop that runs until the stream
 *        empties by repeatedly calling this function, always will terminate at some point.
 *        This is a desired feature which greatly simplifies error handling. If you find a block with this function,
 *        you are guaranteed it is exactly [return value] number of bytes large, and that those bytes are available
 *        in the stream.
