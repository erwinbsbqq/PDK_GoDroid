/**
 * @brief This function acceps a set of essl source code and returns the binary of a shader, performing compilation.
 * @param so A binary shader object. The result will be placed in this struct.
 * @param concatenated_strings The concatenated string containing the shader code to compile.
 * @param The length of each substring in the concatenated string. An array of u32 values.
 * @param source_string_count The number of source strings that the concatenated string was built from (also arraysize of string_lengths).
 * @param shadertype Either BS_FRAGMENT_SHADER or BS_VERTEX_SHADER
 * @return Whether this function failed or not, according to the following rules:
 *
 * 			MALI_ERR_NO_ERROR - there was no internal errors, compilation may or may not have succeeded.
 * 			                    Check the compiled flag and/or log. Shader object state is valid.
 * 			MALI_ERR_FUNCTION_FAILED - Compiler failed on an internal error. Compilation has failed. Error log
 * 			                    may or may not be present. Shader object state is valid, but not nescessarily
 * 			                    complete. Contains the information created up to the point of the crash.
 * 			MALI_ERR_OUT_OF_MEMORY - Compiler ran out of memory, compilation failed. Error log may or may not be present.
 * 			                    Shader object -may- contain information up to the point of the crash, but it may also be
 * 			                    zeroed out.
