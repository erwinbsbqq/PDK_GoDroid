*   FUNCTION
*
*       mcapi_msg_available
*
*   DESCRIPTION
*
*       Non-blocking API routine to check for a connectionless message on
*       a local endpoint.
*
*   INPUTS
*
*       receive_endpoint        The local endpoint identifer being checked
*                               for incoming data.
*       *mcapi_status           A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the status of the call.
*
*   OUTPUTS
*
*       The number of mcapi_msg_recv() operations that are guaranteed
*       to not block waiting for incoming data.
