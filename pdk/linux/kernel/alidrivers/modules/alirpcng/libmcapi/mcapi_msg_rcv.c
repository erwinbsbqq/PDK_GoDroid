*   FUNCTION
*
*       mcapi_msg_recv
*
*   DESCRIPTION
*
*       Blocking API routine to receive a connectionless message on a

*
*   INPUTS
*
*       receive_endpoint        The local endpoint identifer that is
*                               receiving the data.
*       *buffer                 A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the received data.
*       buffer_size             The number of bytes that will fit in *buffer.
*       *received_size          The number of bytes received.
*       *mcapi_status           A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the status of the call.
