*
*   FUNCTION
*
*       mcapi_pktchan_send_i
*
*   DESCRIPTION
*
*       Non-blocking API routine to transmit a packet on a connected
*       channel.  The routine returns immediately, but the data transfer
*       will not complete until there is sufficient free space in the
*       channel's receive buffer.
*
*   INPUTS
*
*       send_handle             The local handle identifier over which the
*                               packet is being sent.
*       *buffer                 A pointer to the data to transmit.
*       size                    The number of bytes of data to transmit.
*       *request                A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with data relevant to the operation, so the
*                               status of the operation can later be checked.
*       *mcapi_status           A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the status of the call.
*
*   OUTPUTS
*
*       None.
