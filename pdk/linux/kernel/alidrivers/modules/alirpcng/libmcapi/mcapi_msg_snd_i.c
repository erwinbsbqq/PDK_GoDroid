/*************************************************************************
*
*   FUNCTION
*
*       mcapi_msg_send_i
*
*   DESCRIPTION
*
*       Non-blocking API routine to transmit a connectionless message from
*       a local endpoint to a specific endpoint.
*
*   INPUTS
*
*       send_endpoint           The endpoint identifier on the local node
*                               that is sending the data.
*       receive_endpoint        The remote endpoint identifer that is
*                               receiving the data.
*       *buffer                 A pointer to the data to transmit.
*       buffer_size             The number of bytes of data to transmit.
*       priority                The desired priority of the buffer on
*                               transmission.
*       *request                A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with data relevant to the operation, so the
*                               status of the operation can later be checked.
*       *mcapi_status           A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the status of the call.
*
*   OUTPUTS
*
*       None.
