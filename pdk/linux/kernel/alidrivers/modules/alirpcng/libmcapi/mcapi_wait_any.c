*   FUNCTION
*
*       mcapi_wait_any
*
*   DESCRIPTION
*
*       Blocking API routine that waits for any non-blocking operation in
*       a list of operations to complete.  The routine returns if any of
*       the specific operations has completed or been canceled, or if the
*       call to mcapi_wait_any times out on completion of the respective
*       operation.
*
*   INPUTS
*
*       number                  The number of non-blocking operations in
*                               the *requests array.
*       **requests              A pointer to an array of number request
*                               structures, each filled in by the specific
*                               operation waiting for completion.
*       *size                   A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the number of bytes sent/received if
*                               the operation in question is a send or
*                               receive operation.
*       timeout                 The number milliseconds to wait for
*                               completion of the respective operation
*                               before returning from mcapi_wait_any().
*                               A value of MCAPI_TIMEOUT_INFINITE indicates no
*                               timeout.
*       *mcapi_status           A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the status of the call.
*
*   OUTPUTS
*
*       The index into the requests array indicating which operation
*       completed.
