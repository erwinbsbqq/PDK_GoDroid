/*************************************************************************
*
*   FUNCTION
*
*       mcapi_pktchan_recv_i
*
*   DESCRIPTION
*
*       Non-blocking API routine to receive a packet on a connected channel.
*       The routine returns a pointer to a system-supplied buffer that must
*       be returned to the system via a call to mcapi_pktchan_free().
*
*   INPUTS
*
*       receive_handle          The local receive handle identifer.
*       **buffer                A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the address of a system-supplied buffer
*                               containing the received packet.
*       *request                A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with data relevant to the operation, so the
*                               status of the operation can later be checked.
*       *mcapi_status           A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the status of the call.
*
*   OUTPUTS
*
*       None.
