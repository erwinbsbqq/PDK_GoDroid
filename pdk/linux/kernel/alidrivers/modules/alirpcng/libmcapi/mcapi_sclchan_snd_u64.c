*
*   FUNCTION
*
*       mcapi_sclchan_send_uint64
*
*   DESCRIPTION
*
*       Blocking API routine to transmit a 64-bit scalar on a connected
*       channel.  The routine returns once the buffer can be reused by
*       the application.
*
*   INPUTS
*
*       send_handle             The local handle identifier over which the
*                               packet is being sent.
*       *buffer                 A pointer to the data to transmit.
*       size                    The number of bytes of data to transmit.
*       *mcapi_status           A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the status of the call.
*
*   OUTPUTS
*
*       None.
