/*************************************************************************
*
*   FUNCTION
*
*       mcapi_connect_sclchan_i
*
*   DESCRIPTION
*
*       Non-blocking API routine to establish a scalar channel connection
*       between two endpoints.  The connection can be established by
*       the sender, the receiver, or a third party, but must be called
*       only once for a given set of endpoints.  The type of channel and
*       attributes of both endpoints must match to make a connection.  Once
*       two endpoints are connected, their attributes cannot be changed.
*
*   INPUTS
*
*       send_endpoint           The sending endpoint of the connection.
*       receive_endpoint        The receiving endpoint of the connection.
*       *request                A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with data relevant to the operation, so the
*                               status of the operation can later be checked.
*       *mcapi_status           A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the status of the call.
*
*   OUTPUTS
*
*       None.
