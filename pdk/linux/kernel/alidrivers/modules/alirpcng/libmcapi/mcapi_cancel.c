*
*   FUNCTION
*
*       mcapi_cancel
*
*   DESCRIPTION
*
*       Blocking API routine to cancel an outstanding non-blocking
*       operation.  Any pending calls to mcapi_wait() or mcapi_wait_any()
*       for the specific operation will also be canceled.
*
*   INPUTS
*
*       *request                A pointer to the request structure filled
*                               in by the specific operation being canceled.
*       *mcapi_status           A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the status of the call.
*
*   OUTPUTS
*
*       None.
