*   FUNCTION
*
*       mcapi_get_endpoint_i
*
*   DESCRIPTION
*
*       Non-blocking API routine to retrieve the endpoint identifier
*       associated with a specific node ID and port ID.
*
*   INPUTS
*
*       node_id                 The unique ID of the node on which the target
*                               endpoint resides.
*       port_id                 The port ID of the target endpoint.
*       *endpoint               A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the endpoint identifier associated
*                               with the node ID / port ID combination.
*       *request                A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with data relevant to the operation, so the
*                               status of the operation can later be checked.
*       *mcapi_status           A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the status of the call.
*
*   OUTPUTS
*
*       None.
