/*************************************************************************
*
*   FUNCTION
*
*       mcapi_open_pktchan_recv_i
*
*   DESCRIPTION
*
*       Non-blocking API routine to open the receive side of a packet
*       channel.  Opens are required on both the send and receive side
*       to send/receive data over the channel.
*
*   INPUTS
*
*       *recv_handle            A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the receive handle associated with
*                               the connection.
*       receive_endpoint        The receiving endpoint of the connection.
*       *request                A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with data relevant to the operation, so the
*                               status of the operation can later be checked.
*       *mcapi_status           A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the status of the call.
*
*   OUTPUTS
*
*       None.
