*
*   DESCRIPTION
*
*       Non-blocking API routine to return a system buffer.
*
*   INPUTS
*
*       *buffer                 A pointer to the buffer to return.
*       *mcapi_status           A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the status of the call.
*
*   OUTPUTS
*
*       The number of receive operations that are guaranteed to not block
*       waiting for incoming data.
