*   FUNCTION
*
*       msg_recv
*
*   DESCRIPTION
*
*       Send a connectionless message to an endpoint.  Called by both
*       blocking and non-blocking transmission routines.
*
*   INPUTS
*
*       receive_endpoint        The local endpoint identifer that is
*                               receiving the data.
*       *buffer                 A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the received data.
*       buffer_size             The number of bytes that will fit in *buffer.
*       *bytes_recv             The numer of bytes received.
*       *request                A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with data relevant to the operation, so the
*                               status of the operation can later be checked.
*       *mcapi_status           A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the status of the call.
*       timeout                 The amount of time to block for the operation
*                               to complete.
*
*   OUTPUTS
*
*       None.
