*
*   FUNCTION
*
*       mcapi_delete_endpoint
*
*   DESCRIPTION
*
*       API routine to delete a specific endpoint on the local node.
*       An endpoint can be deleted only by the node that created the
*       endpoint.  All pending incoming messages will be discarded
*       upon deletion.  If the endpoint is a packet or scalar, the
*       connection must be closed before deleting the endpoint.
*
*   INPUTS
*
*       endpoint                The endpoint identifier on the local node
*                               to delete.
*       *mcapi_status           A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the status of the call.
*
*   OUTPUTS
*
*       The endpoint identifier associated with the node ID / port ID
*       combination.
