*   FUNCTION
*
*       pkt_rcv
*
*   DESCRIPTION
*
*       Receive a packet over a connected channel.  Called by both
*       blocking and non-blocking transmission routines.
*
*   INPUTS
*
*       receive_handle          The local handle that is receiving the data.
*       **buffer                A pointer to a pointer that will be set to the
*                               memory address of the incoming buffer.
*       *received_size          The number of bytes received.
*       *request                A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with data relevant to the operation, so the
*                               status of the operation can later be checked.
*       *mcapi_status           A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the status of the call.
*       timeout                 The amount of time to block for the operation
*                               to complete.
*
*   OUTPUTS
*
*       None.
