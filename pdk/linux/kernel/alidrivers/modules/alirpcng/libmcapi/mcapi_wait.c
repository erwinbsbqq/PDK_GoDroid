*   FUNCTION
*
*       mcapi_wait
*
*   DESCRIPTION
*
*       Blocking API routine that waits for a non-blocking operation to
*       complete.  The routine returns if the specific operation has
*       completed or been canceled, or if the call to mcapi_wait times
*       out on completion of the respective operation.
*
*   INPUTS
*
*       *request                A pointer to the request structure filled
*                               in by the specific operation waiting for
*                               completion.
*       *size                   A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the number of bytes sent/received if
*                               the operation in question is a send or
*                               receive operation.
*       *mcapi_status           A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the status of the call.
*       timeout                 The number milliseconds to wait for
*                               completion of the respective operation
*                               before returning from mcapi_wait().
*                               A value of MCAPI_TIMEOUT_INFINITE indicates no
*                               timeout.
*
*   OUTPUTS
*
*       MCAPI_TRUE              The operation has completed.
*       MCAPI_FALSE             An error has occurred.
