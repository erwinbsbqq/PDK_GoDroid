*   FUNCTION
*
*       get_endpoint
*
*   DESCRIPTION
*
*       Retrieves the endpoint identifier associated with a specific node
*       ID and port ID.
*
*   INPUTS
*
*       node_id                 The unique ID of the node on which the target
*                               endpoint resides.
*       port_id                 The port ID of the target endpoint.
*       *mcapi_status           A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the status of the call.
*       timeout                 The amount of time to block for the operation
*                               to complete.
*
*   OUTPUTS
*
*       The endpoint identifier associated with the node ID / port ID
*       combination.
