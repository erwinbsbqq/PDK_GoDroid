*
*   FUNCTION
*
*       mcapi_data_available
*
*   DESCRIPTION
*
*       Non-blocking API routine to check for data on an endpoint.
*
*   INPUTS
*
*       *rx_endp_ptr            A pointer to the endpoint being checked
*                               for data.
*       type                    The type of channel; packet or scalar.
*       *msg_count              A pointer to the number of receive calls
*                               that will complete without blocking.
*       *mcapi_status           A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the status of the call.
*
*   OUTPUTS
*
*       The number of receive operations that are guaranteed to not block
*       waiting for incoming data.
