*
*   FUNCTION
*
*       mcapi_create_endpoint
*
*   DESCRIPTION
*
*       API routine to create an endpoint on the local node.  If the port
*       ID field is set to MCAPI_PORT_ANY, an endpoint will be created using
*       the next available port in the system.
*
*   INPUTS
*
*       port_id                 The port ID of the endpoint, or MCAPI_PORT_ANY
*                               to create an endpoint with the next available
*                               port ID.
*       *mcapi_status           A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the status of the call.
*
*   OUTPUTS
*
*       The newly created endpoint.
