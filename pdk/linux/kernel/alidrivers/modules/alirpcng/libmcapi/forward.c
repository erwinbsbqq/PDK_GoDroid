*
*   DESCRIPTION
*
*       Forwards an MCAPI packet to another node.
*
*   INPUTS
*
*       *node_data              A pointer to the global structure holding
*                               data about the local node.
*       *mcapi_buf_ptr          A pointer to the buffer to be forwarded.
*       buf_idx                 Index to the mcapi_buf_ptr.
*       dest_node               The final destination node.
*
*   OUTPUTS
*
*       None.
