1. Set default CROSS_COMPILE=/opt/mips-4.4/bin/mips-linux-gnu-
 (Shanghai linux server and Zhuhai SCT server set to this.)
2. Change filetype to xtext (set exec bit) for following files:
  build.sh, release.sh, mkconfig, tools/scripts/make-asm-offsets
3. add prompt message "Please ensure you already select Nand/Nor flash and other setting correctly in board/ali-stb/ali-stb.h,otherwize the customer will build failure if he change these setting (Y/n)"

LABEL: u-boot_C3701C_RELEASE_20120831
date:  2012-8-31 18:04:08

1. Add nor flash support for C3701C u-boot

LABEL: u-boot_C3701H_NAND_20120831
date:  2012-8-31 18:01:37

1. Use name to read/write a partition instead of PartIdx.
2. Leave the fist argument as 0 when pass arguments from u-boot & Ali-boot to kernel according to ZhangHong's suggestion.

LABEL: u-boot201204_C3701H_20120824
date:  2012-8-24 16:52:06

1. Fix a nand write bug: 64 bytes is writen as 0xFF after 0x20000 bytes is writen.This result in a bug: the .UBO header verify failure.
2. Better output for 'nand dump' command.
3. enable "reset" command.
4. pass command line arguments from u-boot to kernel.
  (rootfs partition and mac address)
5. Add release.sh script.
6. Change the entry address from Aliboot to u-boot to 0xa3000200 per ZhangHong's design document.
7. add Guide.txt


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2012-08-17 U-boot_20120401 first release.

A. New added commands:

  1. pmi info				//show Product Module Information.
  2. part show			//show Nand partitions list which is stored in PMI.
     part load			//Load a partition to a specified RAM address.
     part update    //Erase and write the partition from the specified RAM address.
  3. stbid show			//show Mac address,Serial number,OUI and HW version stored in the 'stbid' partition.
     stbid set_mac	//set a new mac address. The new mac address must be valid, otherwize will refuse the modification.
     stbid set_sn		//set the board serial number
  4. boot_ali				//Load the kernel and see code to execute.

B. Other often used commands.

  1.tftpboot					//Load a code to SDRAM by tftp protocal,but don't start to execute. so name it 'tftp' may be better to understand.
  2.go 								//Start to execute from the specified address.
  3.bootm							//The command will check the (.UBO) header validation,then start to execute it after the header.
                      //The command also can pass some arguments to kernel (Linux).
  4.printenv					//print the current enviroment variable setting.
  5.setenv						//set/modify the enviroment variable value.
  6.ping							//check the network is connected or not. Maybe you should use 'eth up' command to turn on ethernet function.
  7.nand bad					//show bad blocks in the Nand flash.
  8.md								//display memory content in the specified address.
  9.help							//list the supported commands,or print the usage of the specified command.
  
C. TO-DO items:

DONE   1. pass some arguments to Linux. (Need to check with Lorin/other,what parameters are needed to pass?)
DONE  2. create release script: Ali's USB/MAC/Nand driver code (including this ChangeLog.txt file) is not open to our customer.
   3. boot application selection: Kernal or OTA loader?
DONE  4. enable user change the MAC/IP/Gateway/Netmask address to fit the different work enviroment.
   5. Too many warning error in ali's specified source code, I will try  to remove it.
   6. system crash when set memory size to 256M in 256M board. (Set to 128/192M is okay.)
   7. whether the u-boot enviroment varible need be saved? Eg. User-defined Mac addres/network parameters. if yes, where to save, Flash data area
     or OOB area?
DONE  8. USB boot function.
DONE   9. Currently the partition name is NULL, if new MPTool can write the real partition name to PMI area, I will modified my code to get the 
      kernel/see/ota loader partition number by name.
DONE   12. tftp 80100000 main_bin.ubo;part update 6 80100000 len, then "CRC verify error" (nand write verify fail (-5))
DONE  13 USB fatload timeout
DONE   14 Nor flash load kernel/See code
   10. u-boot porting for 3921 SOC based on ARM.
   11. other bugfix.

D. Why I suggest to use the latest u-boot version. (2012.04.01)

  1. The original u-boot from Chuhua.tang is 1.1.6, which was released in 2006. It seems a little too old.
     Moreover, I ever compared the verison with the official 1.1.6 version, there are too more useless files in it.
  2. When David Shih send me the USB (EHCI) driver to me, his u-boot version is based on u-boot 2011.09. The version had much better 
     architecture,more like Linux kernel. It support more mips/ARM chips. The change (compare with official 2011.09 version) is much less 
     than the original 1.1.6. We can understand the the changes more easily.
     (The newer u-boot use a release date as its version number,not the tranditional verison number.)
  3. SCT team's target is to provide a unified core code to all BU in the future. I think we should have a far viewpoint, so we should use 
     a better u-boot version as our base. (Generally speaking, Newer means better quality.)
